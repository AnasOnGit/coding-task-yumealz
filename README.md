# üë®‚ÄçüíªYumealz Coding Task

This project is my submission for Yumealz coding task, which includes the following requirements:

## Requirements

1. The user should be able to view orders.
2. The user should be able to view a single order.
3. The user should be able to view captains.
4. The user should be able to view a captain page, which includes some statistics about the captain's performance.
5. The user should be able to assign a captain for a set of orders.
6. The user should be able to view an additional captain's performance report.

### Optional Task

- (FRONTEND) Develop a dynamic comparison page that visually contrasts the performance, achievements, and attributes of two captains.

- (BACKEND) Implement an endpoint that generates an estimation of a
delivery date for a given order based on the delivery distance and the
expected load in your system while taken into consideration historical of
the captain data in building the estimation, feel free to build historical
dummy data (or use any publicly published dataset) to aid you in building
a solution with high accuracy.
